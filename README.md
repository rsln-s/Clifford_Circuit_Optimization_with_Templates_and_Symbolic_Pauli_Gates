# Data to accompany "Clifford Circuit Optimization with Templates and Symbolic Pauli Gates"

To reproduce the figures and tables, uncompress `all-data.zip` into the folder containing `generate_figures_and_tables.py`. Then run `generate_figures_and_tables.py`. Note the `generate_figures_and_tables.py` also verifies that all circuits are correct. This can take multiple hours. To skip, simply comment out the verification code (lines 43 and 98)
